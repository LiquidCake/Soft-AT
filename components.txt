6 - DIP14

(possibly 1 DIP4 pannel to solder CPC1117N on)						
						
						
						
# Relay						
1 RL1 - CPC1117N - or any normally-closed 5v relay capable of 150ma load current						
And if you use CPC1117N optoMOS relay and it is in SMD packaging like in my case - you will need to solder it somehow, e.g. i soldered i on top of DIP4 IC pannel						
						
1 RL2 - Power relay module - 5v logically controlled active-low normally-open 2-channel relay - e.g. active-low "2 CHANNEL 5V 10A RELAY MODULE" for Arduino based on SRD-05VDC-SL-C						
Load current depends on your PC consumption, generally 10A is good	

Suggest to mount by drilling holes (see them on silk) in PCB and using cable ties
						
						
# PCB pin header 2-pin pairs, e.g. PLS-40:						
3 - for irq jumpers						
1 - for battery block 6v						
1 - for soft power button						
2 - for power relay power/control						
2 - for force shutdown buttons						
(9 pairs / 18pins total)						
						
						
# Molex power connector						
1 - molex power connector - male header with spacing 2.54mm, e.g. NS25-W4K-SM WH-04R						
						
						
# DIP switch						
1 DSW1 - 7 contact pairs DIP switch						
						
						
# Battery						
1 - any 6v battery set capable to drive power relay which consumes ~100ma (with some peak at launch) for short period between power on and PSU is fully started
E.g. generic flat battery bay for 4 AA batteries

Suggest to mount by drilling holes (see them on silk) in PCB and using cable ties

						
# Buttons						
1 - push button for soft power, like "power sw" in ATX PC case (or just use soft power button of PC case if using ATX case)					
2 - push buttons for force-shutdown (or you may use PC reset button for upper button contacts pair + another custom button mounted on board back pannel for lower pair)					
						
						
# Cabels						
4 - short but thick power cables to connect PC's AT power supply to power relay load terminals						
Must have proper-size terminals attached to one end (same as on AT power supply button) - e.g. DEGSON K12-00AH						
Isolate carefully						
						
WARNING - high voltage is here, even when relay is open						
						
4 - short cables with female connectors (like NINIGI NSR-02) on both sides to connect power relay module 5v power / control pins with PCB header pins						
						
# Also:						
Battery bay,						
Soft power button,						
Force shutdown buttons pair -						
all must end with cables with female connectors to put on PCB header pins						
(4 pairs of wires + connectors)						
						
						
# Jumper						
1 - jumper for IRQ selection
